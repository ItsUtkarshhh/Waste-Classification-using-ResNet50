## Project Overview
The Waste Classification Model helps in classifying waste into different categories such as paper, plastic, glass, etc., using a deep learning model. It is trained using the Trashnet dataset and implements evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Confusion Matrix.

## Features
- Multi-class classification of waste images.
- PyTorch based training and inference.
- Supports metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- Pretrained Model can be loaded and used for inference on new images.

## Tech Stack
- Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Scikit-Learn (for metrics)
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation)
